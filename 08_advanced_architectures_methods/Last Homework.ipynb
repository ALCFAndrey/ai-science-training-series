    "I would like to use AI to predict the salary increase an employee should demand from their employee. The factors that I would use for this data include inflation, CPI, hours overtime worked, performance review. I would lag the variables and predict on the % salary increase. I believe any of the supervised learning methods and perhaps, deep learning will be appropriate in solving this problem. I would most likely use some type of an ensemble model such as Adaboost.\n"
